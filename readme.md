step by step procedure for making this static web app:
1. Converted my CV from pdf to seperate .html and .css files
2. By following this [Quickstart manual](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/static-web-apps/get-started-portal?tabs=vanilla-javascript&pivots=github) manual, first created a github repository.
3. In the /src folder, uploaded my .html and .css files and removed the default ones.
4. Added other files used in the webpage to this folder too (using the full path in the html code).
5. from the azure portal, searched for static web app option and created a new static web app.
6. configured its options by opting for the free version, and deploying it from an eastasia server from advanced options since thats one of the allowed ones.
7. added the github account to it and opened the repo in it.
8. then clicked on review and create and then create.
9. then from open the resource option, a URL for the website was created which can be used to access the [resume](https://brave-pebble-05c14fb00.2.azurestaticapps.net/) as deployed to the azure server.
